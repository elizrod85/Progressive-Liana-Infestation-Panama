These is the current clean data set: all dead and other outlier trees were removed. This is the final dataset used for all the analyses. 

## Columns in R
GPS: Unique number for each tree.

Species: Species code (Typically 4 first letters of *Genus* followed by 2 first letters of the *epithet*). 

LianaPercentageRemoval: Liana percentage removal treatment applied. 

DATE_DendroInstall_1.1: Date when dendrometers were installed on trees (mm/dd/yr).

DBHPaintM_1.1: Diameter taken with diametric tape.

DATE_DendroREVM_1.2: Date of revision of the dentrometers (mm/dd/yr).

DBHc_DendroREVM_1.2: Diameter calculated from increase of dendrometers (DBHc) at the time of the revision of dendrometers. 

DATE_2 to DATE_8: Date (mm/dd/yr).

DBHc_AdjustIni: Diameter calculated from increase of dendrometers (DBHc) after the adjustment of all dendrometers.

DBHc_PreCut: Diameter calculated from increase of dendrometers (DBHc) before any liana cut/removal was done.

DBHc_PostCut1 to DBHc_PostCut5: Diameter calculated from the increase of dendrometers after lianas were cut.
