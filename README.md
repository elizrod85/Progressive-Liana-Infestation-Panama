# Progressive-Liana-Infestation-Panama
Dataset of selected trees with 7 different liana removal treatments. Panama 2012-2015

These is the current clean data set with dead trees and other outlier trees removed and with the one all the analyses were performed. 

## Datafile descriptors
GPS: Unique number for each tree.

Species: Species code (Tipically 4 first letters of *Genus* followed by 2 first letters of the *epithet*). 

LianaPercentageRemoval: Liana percentage removal treatment applied. 

DATE_DendroInstall_1.1: Date when dendrometers were installed on trees (mm/dd/yr).
DBHPaintM_1.1: Diameter taken with diametric tape.
DATE_DendroREVM_1.2: Date of revision of the dentrometers (mm/dd/yr).
DBHc_DendroREVM_1.2: Diameter calculated from increase of dendrometers (DBHc) at the time of the revision of dendrometers. 
DATE_2 to DATE 8: Date (mm/dd/yr).
DBHc_AdjustIni: Diameter calculated from increase of dendrometers (DBHc) after the adjustment of all dendrometers.
DBHc_PreCut: Diameter calculated from increase of dendrometers (DBHc) before any liana cut/removal was done.
DBHc_PostCut1 to DBHc_PostCut5: Diameter calculated from the increase of dendrometers after lianas were cut.
